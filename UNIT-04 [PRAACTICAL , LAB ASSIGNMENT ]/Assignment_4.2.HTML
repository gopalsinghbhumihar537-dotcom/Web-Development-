  <!--
  QUESTION 2:
  What are Promises in JavaScript, and how do async/await
  simplify working with asynchronous code?
  =======================================================
  -->

  <!--
  INTRODUCTION
  ------------

  JavaScript is an asynchronous language, which means
  some operations (like API calls, file loading, timers)
  take time to complete.

  Promises and async/await are used to handle asynchronous
  operations in a clean and readable way.
  -->

  <!--
  WHAT IS A PROMISE?
  -----------------

  A Promise is an object that represents the eventual
  completion or failure of an asynchronous operation.

  A Promise has three states:
  1) Pending   → Initial state
  2) Fulfilled → Operation completed successfully
  3) Rejected  → Operation failed
  -->

  <!--
  PROMISE EXAMPLE
  ---------------

  This example shows a Promise that resolves successfully
  after 2 seconds.
  -->

  <script>
    let myPromise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
      let success = true;

      setTimeout(() => {
        if (success) {
          resolve("Promise resolved successfully!");
        } else {
          reject("Promise rejected!");
        }
      }, 2000);
    });

    myPromise
      .then(result => {
        console.log(result);
      })
      .catch(error => {
        console.log(error);
      });
  </script>

  <!--
  ASYNC / AWAIT
  -------------

  async and await are modern JavaScript keywords that
  make working with Promises easier and more readable.

  - async makes a function return a Promise
  - await pauses the execution until the Promise resolves
  -->

  <!--
  ASYNC / AWAIT EXAMPLE
  --------------------

  The same Promise is handled using async/await.
  -->

  <script>
    async function handlePromise() {
      try {
        let result = await myPromise;
        console.log(result);
      } catch (error) {
        console.log(error);
      }
    }

    handlePromise();
  </script>

  <!--
  DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PROMISES AND ASYNC/AWAIT
  ------------------------------------------

  Promises:
  - Use .then() and .catch()
  - Can become difficult to read for multiple operations

  async/await:
  - Looks like synchronous code
  - Easier to read and understand
  -->

  <!--
  CONCLUSION
  ----------

  Promises help handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript.
  async/await simplify Promise handling by making the code
  cleaner, more readable, and easier to maintain.
