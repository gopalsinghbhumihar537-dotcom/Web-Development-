  <!--
  QUESTION 2:
  Describe the various Control Flow statements in JavaScript,
  specifically highlighting the difference between for, while,
  and do-while loops.
  =============================================================
  -->

  <!--
  INTRODUCTION
  ------------

  Control Flow statements in JavaScript are used to control the
  order in which statements are executed. They allow the program
  to make decisions, repeat tasks, and execute code conditionally.
  -->

  <!--
  TYPES OF CONTROL FLOW STATEMENTS
  -------------------------------

  1) Conditional Statements
     - if
     - if-else
     - else-if
     - switch

  2) Looping Statements
     - for loop
     - while loop
     - do-while loop

  3) Jump Statements
     - break
     - continue
     - return
  -->

  <!--
  LOOPING STATEMENTS
  -----------------

  Loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly
  as long as a given condition is true.
  -->

  <!--
  1) for LOOP
  -----------

  - Used when the number of iterations is known
  - Entry-controlled loop
  -->

  <!-- Example: Print numbers from 1 to 5 using for loop -->
  <script>
    for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
      console.log(i);
    }
  </script>

  <!--
  2) while LOOP
  -------------

  - Used when number of iterations is not known
  - Entry-controlled loop
  -->

  <!-- Example: Print numbers from 1 to 5 using while loop -->
  <script>
    let i = 1;
    while (i <= 5) {
      console.log(i);
      i++;
    }
  </script>

  <!--
  3) do-while LOOP
  ----------------

  - Executes the loop body at least once
  - Exit-controlled loop
  -->

  <!-- Example: Print numbers from 1 to 5 using do-while loop -->
  <script>
    let j = 1;
    do {
      console.log(j);
      j++;
    } while (j <= 5);
  </script>

  <!--
  DIFFERENCE BETWEEN for, while, AND do-while LOOPS
  ------------------------------------------------

  for loop:
  - Number of iterations is known
  - Condition checked before execution

  while loop:
  - Condition-based loop
  - Condition checked before execution

  do-while loop:
  - Executes at least once
  - Condition checked after execution
  -->

  <!--
  CONCLUSION
  ----------

  Control Flow statements help in controlling the execution
  of JavaScript programs. The for, while, and do-while loops
  are used for repetition, each suitable for different situations.
