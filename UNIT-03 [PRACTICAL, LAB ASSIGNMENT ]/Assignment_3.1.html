  DIFFERENCE BETWEEN var, let, AND const IN JAVASCRIPT
  ===================================================

  JavaScript provides three ways to declare variables: var, let, and const.
  They mainly differ in terms of scope and hoisting.
  -->

  <!--
  1) SCOPE
  --------

  var:
  - Function scoped
  - Not limited to blocks like if, for, or while
  - Accessible anywhere inside the function

  let:
  - Block scoped
  - Accessible only within the block { } where it is declared

  const:
  - Block scoped
  - Same scope rules as let
  -->

  <!--
  2) HOISTING
  -----------

  var:
  - Hoisted to the top of its scope
  - Automatically initialized with undefined
  - Can be accessed before declaration without error

  let:
  - Hoisted but not initialized
  - Exists in the Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)
  - Accessing before declaration causes ReferenceError

  const:
  - Hoisted but not initialized
  - Also in Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)
  - Must be initialized at the time of declaration
  -->

  <!--
  CODE EXAMPLES
  =============
  -->

  <!-- Example using var -->
  <script>
    console.log(a); // Output: undefined
    var a = 10;

    if (true) {
      var x = 5;
    }
    console.log(x); // Output: 5 (not block scoped)
  </script>

  <!-- Example using let -->
  <script>
    // console.log(b); // ReferenceError (TDZ)
    let b = 20;

    if (true) {
      let y = 10;
      console.log(y); // Output: 10
    }
    // console.log(y); // Error: y is block scoped
  </script>

  <!-- Example using const -->
  <script>
    // console.log(c); // ReferenceError (TDZ)
    const c = 30;

    if (true) {
      const z = 15;
      console.log(z); // Output: 15
    }
    // z = 20; // Error: Assignment to constant variable
  </script>

  <!--
  CONCLUSION
  ----------

  var is function scoped and allows re-declaration and hoisting with undefined.
  let is block scoped and safer to use due to the Temporal Dead Zone.
  const is also block scoped and is used for values that should not be reassigned.

  In modern JavaScript, let and const are preferred over var.
